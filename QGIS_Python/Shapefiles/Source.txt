Cartographic Boundary Shapefiles - States
"The cartographic boundary files are simplified representations of selected geographic areas from the Census Bureauâ€™s MAF/TIGER geographic database. These boundary files are specifically designed for small scale thematic mapping. Generalized boundary files are clipped to a simplified version of the U.S. outline. As a result, some off-shore areas may be excluded from the generalized files."
